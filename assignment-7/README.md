# Assignment 7 - Concolic Execution

### :page_with_curl: Challenge
This exercise challenged us to solve the same problem as in the previous weeks - determine which inputs can lead functions to throw one of 4 exceptions. For this week, we were to develop this tool with a **dynamic analysis** point of view. In specific, using **concolic execution**.

Similarly to the last few weeks', this exercise was based on the analysis of Java bytecode, using the [jvm2json](https://gitlab.gbar.dtu.dk/chrg/jvm2json) tool.

The challenge is detailed on [Concolic-Execution.html](https://github.com/immarianaas/pa-23/blob/master/assignment-7/Concolic-Execution.html).

### :bar_chart: Results

No slide was created for this challenge, since the focus at this point was on starting working towards the course project.
